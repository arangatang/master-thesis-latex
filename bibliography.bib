  abstract = {Epidemic forecasting has a dubious track-record, and its failures became more prominent with COVID-19. Poor data input, wrong modeling assumptions, high sensitivity of estimates, lack of incorporation of epidemiological features, poor past evidence on effects of available interventions, lack of transparency, errors, lack of determinacy, consideration of only one or a few dimensions of the problem at hand, lack of expertise in crucial disciplines, groupthink and bandwagon effects, and selective reporting are some of the causes of these failures. Nevertheless, epidemic forecasting is unlikely to be abandoned. Some (but not all) of these problems can be fixed. Careful modeling of predictive distributions rather than focusing on point estimates, considering multiple dimensions of impact, and continuously reappraising models based on their validated performance may help. If extreme values are considered, extremes should be considered for the consequences of multiple dimensions of impact so as to continuously calibrate predictive insights and decision-making. When major decisions (e.g. draconian lockdowns) are based on forecasts, the harms (in terms of health, economy, and society at large) and the asymmetry of risks need to be approached in a holistic fashion, considering the totality of the evidence.}

In this chapter, we give an overview of the most prominent approaches for {HPO}. We ﬁrst discuss blackbox function optimization methods based on model-free methods and Bayesian optimization. Since the high computational demand of many modern machine learning applications renders pure blackbox optimization extremely costly, we next focus on modern multi-ﬁdelity methods that use (much) cheaper variants of the blackbox function to approximately assess the quality of hyperparameter setting.

In real-world exercises, too many choices can create difficulties in selecting the most appropriate technique, especially for users lacking sufficient knowledge of forecasting. This paper provides evidence, in the form of an empirical study on forecasting accuracy, to show that there is no best single method that can perform well for any given forecasting situation. This study focuses on rule induction for forecasting method selection by understanding the nature of historical forecasting data. A novel approach for selecting a forecasting method for univariate time series based on measurable data characteristics is presented that combines elements of datamining, meta-learning, clustering, classification and statistical measurement. Over 300 datasets are selected for the empirical study from diverse fields. Four popular forecasting methods are used in this study to demonstrate prototype knowledge rules. In order to provide a rich portrait of the global characteristics of the time series, we measure: trend, seasonality, periodicity, serial correlation, skewness, kurtosis, non-linearity, self-similarity, and chaos. The derived rules for selecting the most suitable forecasting method based on these novel characteristic measures can provide references and recommendations for forecasters.},

  abstract   = {The goal of this Master thesis is to evaluate the time series forecast capability of several Machine Learning approaches, in detail Neural Nets, Random Forests, Kernel Machines (Support Vector Machines and Gaussian Processes), tree-based and component-wise linear and spline-based Boosting, by a comparison with classical {ARIMA} and {ETS} models. For the classical models also time- series specific bagging approaches, Moving Block Bootstrap and Maximum Entropy Bootstrap, are tested. For this purpose, extensive benchmarks are conducted, utilizing the well-known official Tourism, M3 and {NN}5 competition data with the latter comprising also several exogenous covariate effects. In order to uncover specific problems the Machine Learning approaches reveal for the typical time series components of trend and seasonality, a simulation is executed helping in understanding some benchmark results as well as suggesting combinations of the Machine Learning algorithms with classical deseasoning and detrending steps (Box-Cox transformation, {STL} decomposition, seasonal Differencing). Furthermore different multi-step-ahead forecasting strategies are applied to the {NN}5 time series.
It can be shown that {ARIMA} based models are competitive to Machine Learning models for the investigated classical (without any exogenous covariates) time series forecasting situation. On the other hand, {ETS} approaches are less promising. And the classical models can be enhanced by the tested bagging approaches with the easy-to-use Maximum Entropy Bootstrap showing some advantages over the more known Moving Block Bootstrap. One simple but very important result from the conducted simulation using phenotypic time series is represented by the fact that tree-based models as well as splines with a locality property are incapable of modeling a future trend. In such situations these approaches must be combined with a detrending step resulting in inferior results also for the tree-based boosting model (gbm) as one of the most popular Machine Learning algorithm. Actually the Support Vector Machine is the most promising candidate mostly outperforming all other methods including classical approaches, especially in conjunction with exogenous covariates. Even though Gaussian Processes can be founded in the same theoretical context of Kernel machines, this approach is demystified by its results. Further enhancing the Machine Learning models by direct and hybrid (combination of recursive and direct) forecasting strategies does not reveal any substantial improvements for the tested {NN}5 series. Interestingly, the benchmark on the M3 data conducted in this thesis seem to be the first one revealing a more than competitive prediction of special naïve methods for most series making performance conclusions of other studies based on this data highly questionable.},

In this paper we propose {DeepAR}, a methodology for producing accurate probabilistic forecasts, based on training an auto regressive recurrent network model on a large number of related time series. We demonstrate how by applying deep learning techniques to forecasting, one can overcome many of the challenges faced by widely-used classical approaches to the problem. We show through extensive empirical evaluation on several real-world forecasting data sets accuracy improvements of around 15\% compared to state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract    = {Forecasting is a common data science task that helps organizations with capacity planning, goal setting, and anomaly detection. Despite its importance, there are serious challenges associated with producing reliable and high quality forecasts — especially when there are a variety of time series and analysts with expertise in time series modeling are relatively rare. To address these challenges, we describe a practical approach to forecasting “at scale” that combines configurable models with analyst-in-the-loop performance analysis. We propose a modular regression model with interpretable parameters that can be intuitively adjusted by analysts with domain knowledge about the time series. We describe performance analyses to compare and evaluate forecasting procedures, and automatically flag forecasts for manual review and adjustment. Tools that help analysts to use their expertise most effectively enable reliable, practical forecasting of business time series.},

data: Student's t-test and Welch's t-test. While Welch's t-test does not assume homoscedasticity
(i.e., equal variances), nit involves approximations. A classical textbook recommendation
would be to use Student's t-test if either the two sample sizes are similar or the
two sample variances are similar, and to use Welch's t-test only when both of the
above conditions are violated. However, a more recent recommendation seems to be to
use Welch's t-test unconditionally. Using past data from both TREC and NTCIR, the
present study demonstrates that the latter advice should not be followed blindly in
the context of IR system evaluation. More specifically, our results suggest that if
the sample sizes differ substantially and if the larger sample has a substantially
larger variance,Welch's t-test may not be reliable.},

But {ML} training presents three unique benchmarking challenges absent from other domains: optimizations that improve training throughput can increase the time to solution, training is stochastic and time to solution exhibits high variance, and software and hardware systems are so diverse that fair benchmarking with the same binary, code, and even hyperparameters is difficult. We therefore present {MLPerf}, an {ML} benchmark that overcomes these challenges.

  title    = {Continuous Deployment of Machine Learning Pipelines},
  abstract = {Today machine learning is entering many business and scienti c applications. The life cycle of machine learning applications consists of data preprocessing for transforming the raw data into features, training a model using the features, and deploying the model for answering prediction queries. In order to guarantee accurate predictions, one has to continuously monitor and update the deployed model and pipeline. Current deployment platforms update the model using online learning methods. When online learning alone is not adequate to guarantee the prediction accuracy, some deployment platforms provide a mechanism for automatic or manual retraining of the model. While the online training is fast, the retraining of the model is time-consuming and adds extra overhead and complexity to the process of deployment. We propose a novel continuous deployment approach for updating the deployed model using a combination of the incoming realtime data and the historical data. We utilize sampling techniques to include the historical data in the training process, thus eliminating the need for retraining the deployed model. We also o er online statistics computation and dynamic materialization of the preprocessed features, which further reduces the total training and data preprocessing time. In our experiments, we design and deploy two pipelines and models to process two real-world datasets. The experiments show that continuous deployment reduces the total training cost up to 15 times while providing the same level of quality when compared to the state-of-the-art deployment approaches.},

  abstract   = {Effective collaboration among data scientists results in highquality and efficient machine learning ({ML}) workloads. In a collaborative environment, such as Kaggle or Google Colabratory, users typically re-execute or modify published scripts to recreate or improve the result. This introduces many redundant data processing and model training operations. Reusing the data generated by the redundant operations leads to the more efficient execution of future workloads. However, existing collaborative environments lack a data management component for storing and reusing the result of previously executed operations.},

  abstract     = {Modern Stream Processing Engines ({SPEs}) process large data volumes under tight latency constraints. Many {SPEs} execute processing pipelines using message passing on sharednothing architectures and apply a partition-based scale-out strategy to handle high-velocity input streams. Furthermore, many state-of-the-art {SPEs} rely on a Java Virtual Machine to achieve platform independence and speed up system development by abstracting from the underlying hardware. In this paper, we show that taking the underlying hardware into account is essential to exploit modern hardware eﬃciently. To this end, we conduct an extensive experimental analysis of current {SPEs} and {SPE} design alternatives optimized for modern hardware. Our analysis highlights potential bottlenecks and reveals that state-of-the-art {SPEs} are not capable of fully exploiting current and emerging hardware trends, such as multi-core processors and high-speed networks. Based on our analysis, we describe a set of design changes to the common architecture of {SPEs} to scale-up on modern hardware. We show that the single-node throughput can be increased by up to two orders of magnitude compared to state-of-the-art {SPEs} by applying specialized code generation, fusing operators, batch-style parallelization strategies, and optimized windowing. This speedup allows for deploying typical streaming applications on a single or a few nodes instead of large clusters.},

The {RMSE} is of special interest because it is widely reported in the climatic and environmental literature; nevertheless, it is an inappropriate and misinterpreted measure of average error. {RMSE} is inappropriate because it is a function of 3 characteristics of a set of errors, rather than of one (the average error). {RMSE} varies with the variability within the distribution of error magnitudes and with the square root of the number of errors (n1/2), as well as with the average-error magnitude ({MAE}). Our findings indicate that {MAE} is a more natural measure of average error, and (unlike {RMSE}) is unambiguous. Dimensioned evaluations and inter-comparisons of average model-performance error, therefore, should be based on {MAE}.},

When conditioned on class labels from the {ImageNet} database, the model is able to generate diverse, realistic scenes representing distinct animals, objects, landscapes and structures. When conditioned on an embedding produced by a convolutional network given a single image of an unseen face, it generates a variety of new portraits of the same person with different facial expressions, poses and lighting conditions. We also show that conditional {PixelCNN} can serve as a powerful decoder in an image autoencoder. Additionally, the gated convolutional layers in the proposed model improve the log-likelihood of {PixelCNN} to match the state-ofthe-art performance of {PixelRNN} on {ImageNet}, with greatly reduced computational cost.},

  abstract     = {High-dimensional time series prediction is needed in applications as diverse as demand forecasting and climatology. Often, such applications require methods that are both highly scalable, and deal with noisy data in terms of corruptions or missing values. Classical time series methods usually fall short of handling both these issues. In this paper, we propose to adapt matrix matrix completion approaches that have previously been successfully applied to large scale noisy data, but which fail to adequately model high-dimensional time series due to temporal dependencies. We present a novel temporal regularized matrix factorization ({TRMF}) framework which supports data-driven temporal dependency learning and enables forecasting ability to our new matrix factorization approach. {TRMF} is highly general, and subsumes many existing matrix factorization approaches for time series data. We make interesting connections to graph regularized matrix factorization methods in the context of learning the dependencies. Experiments on both real and synthetic data show that {TRMF} outperforms several existing approaches for common time series tasks.},

Given a new sequence modeling task or dataset, which architecture should one use? We conduct a systematic evaluation of generic convolutional and recurrent architectures for sequence modeling. The models are evaluated across a broad range of standard tasks that are commonly used to benchmark recurrent networks. Our results indicate that a simple convolutional architecture outperforms canonical recurrent networks such as {LSTMs} across a diverse range of tasks and datasets, while demonstrating longer effective memory. We conclude that the common association between sequence modeling and recurrent networks should be reconsidered, and convolutional networks should be regarded as a natural starting point for sequence modeling tasks.

  abstract     = {Training state-of-the-art, deep neural networks is computationally expensive. One way to reduce the training time is to normalize the activities of the neurons. A recently introduced technique called batch normalization uses the distribution of the summed input to a neuron over a mini-batch of training cases to compute a mean and variance which are then used to normalize the summed input to that neuron on each training case. This significantly reduces the training time in feed-forward neural networks. However, the effect of batch normalization is dependent on the mini-batch size and it is not obvious how to apply it to recurrent neural networks. In this paper, we transpose batch normalization into layer normalization by computing the mean and variance used for normalization from all of the summed inputs to the neurons in a layer on a single training case. Like batch normalization, we also give each neuron its own adaptive bias and gain which are applied after the normalization but before the non-linearity. Unlike batch normalization, layer normalization performs exactly the same computation at training and test times. It is also straightforward to apply to recurrent neural networks by computing the normalization statistics separately at each time step. Layer normalization is very effective at stabilizing the hidden state dynamics in recurrent networks. Empirically, we show that layer normalization can substantially reduce the training time compared with previously published techniques.},

A single {WaveNet} can capture the characteristics of many different speakers with equal fidelity, and can switch between them by conditioning on the speaker identity.

In this paper, we proposed a novel deep learning framework, namely Long- and Short-term Time-series network ({LSTNet}), to address this open challenge. {LSTNet} uses the Convolution Neural Network ({CNN}) and the Recurrent Neural Network ({RNN}) to extract short-term local dependency patterns among variables and to discover long-term patterns for time series trends. Furthermore, we leverage traditional autoregressive model to tackle the scale insensitive problem of the neural network model. In our evaluation on real-world data with complex mixtures of repetitive patterns, {LSTNet} achieved significant performance improvements over that of several state-of-the-art baseline methods.

We propose to combine an {RNN}-based time series model with a Gaussian copula process output model with a low-rank covariance structure to reduce the computational complexity and handle non-Gaussian marginal distributions. This permits to drastically reduce the number of parameters and consequently allows the modeling of time-varying correlations of thousands of time series.

  abstract = {In time series predictor evaluation, we observe that with respect to the model selection procedure there is a gap between evaluation of traditional forecasting procedures, on the one hand, and evaluation of machine learning techniques on the other hand. In traditional forecasting, it is common practice to reserve a part from the end of each time series for testing, and to use the rest of the series for training. Thus it is not made full use of the data, but theoretical problems with respect to temporal evolutionary effects and dependencies within the data as well as practical problems regarding missing values are eliminated. On the other hand, when evaluating machine learning and other regression methods used for time series forecasting, often cross-validation is used for evaluation, paying little attention to the fact that those theoretical problems invalidate the fundamental assumptions of cross-validation. To close this gap and examine the consequences of different model selection procedures in practice, we have developed a rigorous and extensive empirical study. Six different model selection procedures, based on (i) cross-validation and (ii) evaluation using the series’ last part, are used to assess the performance of four machine learning and other regression techniques on synthetic and real-world time series. No practical consequences of the theoretical flaws were found during our study, but the use of cross-validation techniques led to a more robust model selection. To make use of the “best of both worlds”, we suggest that the use of a blocked form of cross-validation for time series evaluation became the standard procedure, thus using all available information and circumventing the theoretical problems.}

  abstract     = {Producing probabilistic forecasts for large collections of similar and/or dependent time series is a practically relevant and challenging task. Classical time series models fail to capture complex patterns in the data, and multivariate techniques struggle to scale to large problem sizes. Their reliance on strong structural assumptions makes them data-efﬁcient, and allows them to provide uncertainty estimates. The converse is true for models based on deep neural networks, which can learn complex patterns and dependencies given enough data. In this paper, we propose a hybrid model that incorporates the beneﬁts of both approaches. Our new method is data-driven and scalable via a latent, global, deep component. It also handles uncertainty through a local classical model. We provide both theoretical and empirical evidence for the soundness of our approach through a necessary and sufﬁcient decomposition of exchangeable time series into a global and a local part. Our experiments demonstrate the advantages of our model both in term of data efﬁciency, accuracy and computational complexity.},

  abstract     = {Because of their effectiveness in broad practical applications, {LSTM} networks have received a wealth of coverage in scientific journals, technical blogs, and implementation guides. However, in most articles, the inference formulas for the {LSTM} network and its parent, {RNN}, are stated axiomatically, while the training formulas are omitted altogether. In addition, the technique of "unrolling" an {RNN} is routinely presented without justification throughout the literature. The goal of this paper is to explain the essential {RNN} and {LSTM} fundamentals in a single document. Drawing from concepts in signal processing, we formally derive the canonical {RNN} formulation from differential equations. We then propose and prove a precise statement, which yields the {RNN} unrolling technique. We also review the difficulties with training the standard {RNN} and address them by transforming the {RNN} into the "Vanilla {LSTM}" network through a series of logical arguments. We provide all equations pertaining to the {LSTM} system together with detailed descriptions of its constituent entities. Albeit unconventional, our choice of notation and the method for presenting the {LSTM} system emphasizes ease of understanding. As part of the analysis, we identify new opportunities to enrich the {LSTM} system and incorporate these extensions into the Vanilla {LSTM} network, producing the most general {LSTM} variant to date. The target reader has already been exposed to {RNNs} and {LSTM} networks through numerous available resources and is open to an alternative pedagogical approach. A Machine Learning practitioner seeking guidance for implementing our new augmented {LSTM} model in software for experimentation and research will find the insights and derivations in this tutorial valuable as well.},

  abstract     = {Consider the problem of sequentially estimating quantiles of any distribution over a complete, fully-ordered set, based on a stream of i.i.d. observations. We propose new, theoretically sound and practically tight confidence sequences for quantiles, that is, sequences of confidence intervals which are valid uniformly over time. We give two methods for tracking a fixed quantile and two methods for tracking all quantiles simultaneously. Specifically, we provide explicit expressions with small constants for intervals whose widths shrink at the fastest possible \${\textbackslash}sqrt\{t{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} {\textbackslash}log{\textbackslash}log t\}\$ rate, as determined by the law of the iterated logarithm ({LIL}). As a byproduct, we give a non-asymptotic concentration inequality for the empirical distribution function which holds uniformly over time with the {LIL} rate, thus strengthening Smirnov's asymptotic empirical process {LIL}, and extending the famed Dvoretzky-Kiefer-Wolfowitz ({DKW}) inequality to hold uniformly over all sample sizes while only being about twice as wide in practice. This inequality directly yields sequential analogues of the one- and two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests, and a test of stochastic dominance. We apply our results to the problem of selecting an arm with an approximately best quantile in a multi-armed bandit framework, proving a state-of-the-art sample complexity bound for a novel allocation strategy. Simulations demonstrate that our method stops with fewer samples than existing methods by a factor of five to fifty. Finally, we show how to compute confidence sequences for the difference between quantiles of two arms in an A/B test, along with corresponding always-valid \$p\$-values.},
